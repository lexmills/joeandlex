            <h1>Our Story</h1>

            <p>Joe and Lex started off as pen pals around Spring Break of 2002, if you can believe it was that long ago.  He was traveling across Europe with Will, she was traveling across Canada with her friend Jen and it was fun sharing their adventures with each other. They shared a number of things in common, but nothing as much as their taste in music and their sense of humor.  Time carried on and they stayed in touch; online chat sessions during class in college, calls on New Years eve and random emails throughout the years catching up.</p>

            <p>Distance and relationships kept them just as friends for many, many years, but around 2005 they found they were both single and out of school.  Joe decided to visit Lex in Cincinnati and they had their first official date at Teak Thai.  Then she visited Joe in Philly and after a day on a blanket in the park she was totally smitten.  The joke to this day is he totally tricked her into thinking that he would ever do that again.</p>

            <p>Yadda, yadda, yadda; now they're getting married.</p>

            <p>This has been quite the journey together, and it's only just beginning!  We are so grateful that you are a part of our adventure together; today and always.</p>
